Like adding the code for how to make one of the circles change colors only when it was touching the other was challenging, and I did get some help from peers. I think the main 
hard part of this project was combining the previously known skills we possesed and actually putting them all together, but with that making them flow seamlesley with each other. 
However, I am proud of the code I have produced. If i where to do so again, I think I would do the same thing except have two different shapes rather then two of the same, but for the 
sake of my skill level just having to circles made it easier.
